            <p><strong>APPOINTMENTS AND CANCELLATIONS</strong>
                - If you cannot attend your individual, family or group session,
                please remember to cancel or reschedule 12 hours in advance.
                You will be responsible for a $65.00 fee if the cancellation is
                less than 12 hours. This is necessary because a time commitment
                is made to you and is held exclusively for you. If you are late
                for a session, you may lose some of that session time. The standard
                meeting time for individual psychotherapy is 45/60 minutes. It is
                up to you, however, to determine the length of time of your sessions.
                Requests to change the 45/60-minute session need to be discussed with
                the therapist in order for time to be scheduled in advance.
            </p><br><br>
            <p><strong>TELEPHONE ACCESSIBILITY</strong>
                - If you need to contact your ABS therapist, please leave a message
                on the voice mail. The therapist may not be immediately available;
                however, they will attempt to return your call within 24 hours.
                Please note that Face- to-face sessions are highly preferable to
                phone sessions. However, in the event that you are out of town,
                sick or need additional support, phone sessions are available.
                If a true emergency situation arises, please call 911 or any local
                emergency room.
            </p><br><br>
            <p><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA AND TELECOMMUNICATION</strong>
                - Due to the importance of your confidentiality and the importance of
                minimizing dual relationships, the therapist will not accept a friend or
                contact requests from current or former clients on any social networking
                site (Facebook, LinkedIn, etc). ABS believes that adding clients as friends
                or contacts on these sites can compromise your confidentiality and our
                respective privacy. It may also blur the boundaries of our therapeutic
                relationship. If you have questions about this, please bring them up in
                therapy with your therapist.
            </p><br><br>
            <p><strong>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION</strong>
                - We cannot ensure the confidentiality of any form of communication through
                electronic media, including text messages. If you prefer to communicate via
                email or text messaging for issues regarding scheduling or cancellations,
                we will do so. While we may try to return messages in a timely manner, we
                cannot guarantee immediate response and request that you do not use these
                methods of communication to discuss therapeutic content and/or request
                assistance for emergencies. Services by electronic means, including but not
                limited to telephone communication, the Internet, facsimile machines, and
                e-mail is considered telemedicine by some states including the State of
                California. Under the California Telemedicine Act of 1996, telemedicine is
                broadly defined as the use of information technology to deliver medical
                services and information from one location to another. If you and your
                therapist chose to use information technology for some or all of your
                treatment, you need to understand that: (1) You retain the option to
                withhold or withdraw consent at any time without affecting the right to
                future care or treatment or risking the loss or withdrawal of any program
                benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled. (2) All existing
                confidentiality protections are equally applicable. (3) Your access to all
                medical information transmitted during a telemedicine consultation is
                guaranteed, and copies of this information are available for a reasonable
                fee. (4) Dissemination of any of your identifiable images or information
                from the telemedicine interaction to researchers or other entities shall
                not occur without your consent.(5) There are potential risks, consequences,
                and benefits of telemedicine. Potential benefits include, but are not
                limited to improved communication capabilities, providing convenient access
                to up-to-date information, consultations, support, reduced costs, improved
                quality, change in the conditions of practice, improved access to therapy,
                better continuity of care, and reduction of lost work time and travel costs.
                Effective therapy is often facilitated when the therapist gathers within a
                session or a series of sessions, a multitude of observations, information,
                and experiences about the client. Therapists may make clinical assessments,
                diagnosis, and interventions based not only on direct verbal or auditory
                communications, written reports, and third person consultations, but also
                from direct visual and olfactory observations, information, and experiences.
                When using information technology in therapy services, potential risks
                include, but are not limited to the therapist’s inability to make visual and
                olfactory observations of clinically or therapeutically potentially relevant
                issues such as: your physical condition including deformities, apparent
                height and weight, body type, attractiveness relative to social and cultural
                norms or standards, gait and motor coordination, posture, work speed, any
                noteworthy mannerism or gestures, physical or medical conditions including
                bruises or injuries, basic grooming and hygiene including appropriateness of
                dress, eye contact (including any changes in the previously listed issues),
                sex, chronological and apparent age, ethnicity, facial and body language,
                and congruence of language and facial or bodily expression. Potential
                consequences thus include the therapist not being aware of what he or she
                would consider important information, that you may not recognize as
                significant to present verbally to the therapist.
            </p><br><br>
            <p><strong>MINORS</strong>
                - If you are a minor, your parents may be legally entitled to some information
                about your therapy. We will discuss with you and your parents’ what information
                is appropriate for them to receive and which issues are more appropriately kept
                confidential.
            </p><br><br>
            <p><strong>TERMINATION</strong>
                - Ending relationships can be difficult. Therefore, it is important to have a
                termination process in order to achieve some closure. The appropriate length of
                the termination depends on the length and intensity of the treatment. ABS may
                terminate treatment after appropriate discussion with you and a termination
                process if ABS determines that the psychotherapy is not being effectively used
                or if you are in default on payment. ABS will not terminate the therapeutic
                relationship without first discussing and exploring the reasons and purpose of
                terminating. If therapy is terminated for any reason or you request another
                therapist, we will provide you with a list of qualified psychotherapists to
                treat you. You may also choose someone on your own or from another referral
                source.Should you fail to schedule an appointment for three consecutive weeks,
                unless other arrangements have been made in advance, for legal and ethical
                reasons, ABS must consider the professional relationship discontinued.
